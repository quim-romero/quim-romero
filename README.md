# 👋 Hi, I'm Quim Romero

**Frontend developer with a product soul.**  
I don’t just build interfaces — I craft intentional, thoughtful, high-performance digital experiences.

I specialize in designing and developing real products from scratch: no fluff, no templates, no noise. I build things that are clear, fast, and feel right.

## 🧬 Who I Am

I’m not driven by trends. I’m driven by logic, experience, and the pursuit of interfaces that just feel right.

I ask questions before writing code:

> Who’s using this? What should it feel like? How can I make it simpler?

Then I build — fast, focused, and with intention.

Once the core works, I enter what I call _“obsessive mode”_:
- Microinteractions
- Keyboard behavior
- Motion feel
- UX clarity
- Semantic structure

Nothing leaves my hands without feeling solid.
